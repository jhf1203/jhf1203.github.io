          I am so excited to share my body of work with you.  Please see below, in 
          descending order, some selections of my work beginning with my first homework 
          assignment at the UNC Coding Bootcamp in June, 2020.</p>

          I pride myself on my ideation and creativity.  My background in Interior Design 
          and my natural left-brain give me a penchant for both meeting parameters 
          and building with functionality in mind, while still humanizing and injecting 
          character into my work.

It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

        <p>This was the first assignment that I completed using JavaScript.  It was my first deep-dive into building script from scratch, and increased my understanding of the importance of preparation prior to generating any script whatsoever.  It was my first time creating functions with multiple elements and operators, and taught me several built-in JavaScript functions that helped with this project's success.

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>With this being my second one using the jQuery library I felt much more in tune with syntax and placement with fewer characters to type out in my commands. It was my first time using a for each loop and understanding its benefit as well. My biggest challenge on this project was local storage, I struggled a bit with its cadence in the beginning. For the first time was able to look at other examples of past class activities with local storage in action and better interpret how I would be able to make it functional to solve on my own, with some guidance from our class TAs.

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>With meteorology being a hobby of mine I was highly engaged in this project, and am happy to know that during my time in this program I'm able to build a comprehensive current weather app from scratch.  I learned how to navigate multiple JSON files to pull relevant data together into a cohesive interface.  Additionally I dove deeper than before into a custom theme for this project, even designing my own weather icons.

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>This was my first group project in the class, and was open-ended given a few parameters: Must use at least two server-side APIs, must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input, must use at least one new third-party API, must have a polished UI, must meet good quality coding standards, and does not use alerts/confirms/prompts
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-5">
        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>Along with two classmates this site was built from scratch, which autopopulates both restaurants and movie selections based off of user criteria entered.  In addition to the information in the summary that was required of the application itself we presented our project to the class and included several pieces: Elevator pitch, concept of and motivation behind the application's development, multiple user stories and our own acceptance criteria, an overview of the processes used, successes and opportunities in the project itself (with respect to the code as well as working in a group setting), how the tasks were broken down amongst the group, a live demonstration, and directions for future development.  We worked excellent together both formulating and conceptualizing at the start as well as de-bugging at the end as a team, and my specific area of focus was the development of the movie generator, lines 213-327 of the code.
