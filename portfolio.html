          I am so excited to share my body of work with you. Please see below, in
          descending order, some selections of my work beginning with my first homework
          assignment at the UNC Coding Bootcamp in June, 2020.</p>

          I pride myself on my ideation and creativity. My background in Interior Design
          and my natural left-brain give me a penchant for both meeting parameters
          and building with functionality in mind, while still humanizing and injecting
          character into my work.

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>This was our second group project for the class, and tasked us with creating a full-stack application of our choosing given certain conditions.  We were required to serve a MySql database through Heroku, using the Sequelize ORM, and our HTML content was required to be rendered with Handlebars for Express. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-5">
        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>This application was done with me being part of a team of four, and was my first experience working on a multi-faceted full-stack project with a team.  In addition to practicing recent languages and libraries, I was able to see clearly how closely together they work given that each member of the team had different assignments and responsibilities.  This was a highly ambitious project with a long list of items for future development with a target completion time of 60 days, so stay posted!

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>This assignment required me to create an app that allows the user to name a burger, and then "devour" it at
          the click of a button. The burger information is stored in a database powered by mySql, and is hosted
          through heroku.

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>This is the closest thing to a full-stack assignment that I've completed so far, in that the front end can
          be manipulated by the user via code on the back end and values that are housed in a database. There are
          multiple API calls on this app, as well as the usage of ORMs and handlebars for templating.

      <div class="col-md-5">
        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>This was my first back-end development assignment, which gave me my first glimpse into how the front-end can be manipulated by the server (despite there not being a server on this particular assignment).  It was also my first experience with templating client-side code from the back-end and has served as a great learning experience as we have since taken a deeper dive into templating engines, ORMs and full-stack development.  Based off of feedback from the grader on this project, it is what I use to generate readMe files for all of my homework assignments since.

        <p>This was my first group project in the class, and was open-ended given a few parameters: Must use at least
          two server-side APIs, must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input, must use at least one new
          third-party API, must have a polished UI, must meet good quality coding standards, and does not use
          alerts/confirms/prompts

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>Along with two classmates this site was built from scratch, which autopopulates both restaurants and movie
          selections based off of user criteria entered. In addition to the information in the summary that was required
          of the application itself we presented our project to the class and included several pieces: Elevator pitch,
          concept of and motivation behind the application's development, multiple user stories and our own acceptance
          criteria, an overview of the processes used, successes and opportunities in the project itself (with respect
          to the code as well as working in a group setting), how the tasks were broken down amongst the group, a live
          demonstration, and directions for future development. We worked excellent together both formulating and
          conceptualizing at the start as well as de-bugging at the end as a team, and my specific area of focus was the
          development of the movie generator, lines 213-327 of the code.

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context
          of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with
          specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and
          feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>With meteorology being a hobby of mine I was highly engaged in this project, and am happy to know that during
          my time in this program I'm able to build a comprehensive current weather app from scratch. I learned how to
          navigate multiple JSON files to pull relevant data together into a cohesive interface. Additionally I dove
          deeper than before into a custom theme for this project, even designing my own weather icons.

        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>With this being my second one using the jQuery library I felt much more in tune with syntax and placement
          with fewer characters to type out in my commands. It was my first time using a for each loop and understanding
          its benefit as well. My biggest challenge on this project was local storage, I struggled a bit with its
          cadence in the beginning. For the first time was able to look at other examples of past class activities with
          local storage in action and better interpret how I would be able to make it functional to solve on my own,
          with some guidance from our class TAs.
